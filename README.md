# Escape - Competitive Snake/Dots Like Multiplayer Game with Chat Functionality and Ability to Create, Join, Or Watch Game Rooms 

![Escape](Escape.gif)

Escape is a mixture of dots and snake. It is a grid system where you move from one dot to another adjacent dot. However, you can't draw over a line that has already been drawn and each dot can only be clicked on 3 times. Once you don't have any available moves then you lose.

I used this project to teach myself typescript and websockets. It has been a lot of fun and there is definitely more things I can do to clean it up. However, it is fully functional the way it is and for never using typescript or websockets before, I am excited with how it turned out.

Definitely love the complexity of programming games and how every component is tied to another and having to come up with ways to account for everything.
